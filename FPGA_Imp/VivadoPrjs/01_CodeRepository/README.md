THESE FILES ARE HERE FOR STORAGE

None of these source files are called in a design. 
They are here for storage. 
Changing these will not change how a project will function. 
Every project has these copied into their directory.

It is done this way so each project and IP is fully packaged and can be copied out of the directory.
