2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_SDA direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_SDA) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_i/AXI_I2C_LCD_Transmitter_0/LCD_SDA direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_i/AXI_I2C_LCD_Transmitter_0/LCD_SDA) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#2 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_i/LCD_SDA direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_SDA_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on LCD_SCL relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on LCD_SDA relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on lcd_reset_n relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
