2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_pl_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn_i[0] relative to clock(s) BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn_i[1] relative to clock(s) BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn_i[2] relative to clock(s) BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn_i[3] relative to clock(s) BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led_0 relative to clock(s) BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-40#1 Advisory
Substitute PLLE4 for MMCME4 check  
The MMCME4 cell BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell BTN_LED_i/clk_wiz/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) BTN_LED_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>
