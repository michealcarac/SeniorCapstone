2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) LCD_SDA_0 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_SDA_0) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) Imp_i/I2C_LCD_Transmitter_1/LCD_SDA direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (Imp_i/I2C_LCD_Transmitter_1/LCD_SDA) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#2 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) Imp_i/LCD_SDA_0 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (LCD_SDA_0_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
